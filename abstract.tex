There are currently 23.14 billion IoT devices in use worldwide, with 75.44 billion expected by 2025. Despite their ubiquity, however, there is little knowledge about the security and privacy implications of these devices. Large botnet attacks like Mirai have been recorded to leverage IoT devices with weak login credentials, enslaving 600,000 IoT devices for a large scale DDOS attack in 2016.

To better understand these security and privacy implications, we have logged a year of network and power data from 16 IoT devices, accumulating 184.94 GB of data and 172,445,929 entries of data.

With this dataset, we show that we can determine the smart speaker in use when viewing just one minute of power usage from multiple devices, even with noise from various high power devices.
