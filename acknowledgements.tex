Thanks to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item My parents for supporting me throughout life. I wouldn't have made it here without your time and effort.
    \item Ryan Frawley for setting up the scripts for logging all of the devices as well as extra analysis on the devices alongside me. You set a really good base for us to build upon!
    \item Cal Poly and Cisco for funding this project. We would not have been able to get all of the IoT devices without your help.
\end{itemize}
