Thanks to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item My parents and sister for supporting me throughout life. I wouldn't have made it here without your time and effort.
    \item Professor Andrew Danowitz for the guidance and knowledge provided. I really enjoyed working with you.
    \item Yuhsin Chang for supporting me throughout my studies.
    \item Ryan Frawley for setting up the scripts for device logging and analysis alongside me. You really set a strong foundation for us to build upon!
    \item Cal Poly and Cisco for funding this project. We would not have had the resources needed to accomplish our task.
\end{itemize}
