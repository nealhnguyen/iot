\noindent
Thanks to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item My parents for supporting me throughout life. I wouldn't have made it here without your time and effort.
    \item Ryan Frawley for setting up the scripts for device logging and analysis alongside me. You really set a strong foundation for us to build upon!
    \item Cal Poly and Cisco for funding this project. We would not have had the resources needed to accomplish our task.
\end{itemize}
