In this chapter, we will discuss the implications of the data presented in chapter \ref{Results}.

\section{Switching Smart Plug}
In section \ref{swappingSwitch}, we displayed figure \ref{fig:switchEchoEufyPlug}. We do this to ensure consistency between measurements. The network traffic is assumed to be consistent because all network traffic will go through our NUC AP, following a standard WiFi connection. However, each device has their power plug in different locations on different power strips. We wanted to check to see that this variation causes minimal recording differences. From the figure \ref{fig:switchEchoEufyPlug}, we can see that after restarting, the power level goes back to where it was before. We did this multiple times with other switches to different locations and obtained nominal changes in the idle power usage. Thus we can conclude that this power logging scheme is relatively consistent.

\section{Metadata Analysis}
In sections \ref{wholeDB}, \ref{smartSpeakerResults} and, \ref{Streaming Devices} we go over the protocol spread, and general power/network usage of varying devices. However, because Frawley's paper \cite{frawley_2018} already analyzes these sections, refer to his paper for analysis.

\section{Power Spike at 18:12}
In figure \ref{fig:bestBballSum}, we saw an unaccounted power spike at 18:12. When looking at figures \ref{fig:bestBballSeperate} and \ref{fig:bestBballNetwork}, we believe that the power surge is from the LEDs. Because there is no network usage in this time, we do not think the Echo Dot was doing anything data recording, listening, or was activated. We believe that the computer was covering the Echo Dot, but is briefly moved, exposing the Echo Dot to more light, thus causing the LEDs to brighten.

\section{Device Fingerprinting}
We want to see if it is possible to determine what devices are in use if given access to home's power line. Classifying devices from a single power usage graph over time consisting of multiple devices is a good simulation for a total powerline.

In sections \ref{sumPowerGraphSection} and \ref{sumPowerGraph}. We show how the smart speakers perform under various operations such as "what's the weather", "who is the best basketball player", or "what's the news". We did this various times to confirm consistency, and we always found that there is a start spike (voltage spike peak to peak value) of around 420 mW for the Eufy Genie, 720 mW for the Google Home, and 2180 mW for the Echo Dot. Whether summing the power usage graphs for the devices up or keeping separate, from the graph, we can tell what device model is being used. The models with multiple units are consistent with each other. Ordering the queries results in the same power spike. Because of all of this, we conclude that we can classify a device model from just a visual examination of its power usage. This is our first step to testing our hypotheses that it is possible to see what devices are in use from analysis of someone's power line.

The next step would be to add noise into our graphs, to see if the smart speaker spikes from commands would still be legible \ref{sumPowerGraphSection}. From the graphs shown, if the power is stable enough, then it will not be a problem for classifying the devices. The device spikes will just be shifted up. This statement is supported by our graphs with the fan, the idle microwave, idle fridge, and idle NUC.

However, if the power usage has noise on the same magnitude or larger than the smart speaker spikes, then it becomes difficult to make out which smart speaker model is currently in use. This is evident when the NUC, fridge, and microwave are in use. However, the microwave and fridge are idle for most the time, so it would still be possible to monitor someone's power line on a time frame that these devices are not being used. However, PCs, smartphones, and streaming devices are constantly in use. So it would be difficult to find a time one the NUC is not in use and make it difficult to determine what smart speaker model is in use form just visual analysis of its power usage. We think that it still might be possible with machine learning, or if network data is added in as well, or both.

From the results of section \ref{sumPowerGraph} and \ref{sumPowerGraphSection}, it is possible to classify the model of a smart speaker from visual examination of a single power usage graph during a time when most other devices are idle. However, with multi-use devices such as a PC, smartphone, or IoT device that is in constant use for long periods of times, it would be challenging to classify a smart speaker model.

\section{Smart Speaker Comparison}
Finally, we noticed that the Echo Dot is characterized by a power spike that is a lot larger than the other smart speakers and was interested to see what trade-offs these devices made.

From the results in section \ref{smartSpeakerComparisonSection}, we can see that the echo uses the most power, then the Eufy, then the Google Home. However, the Eufy uses the most network throughput, than then Google Home, then the Echo Dot. We believe the Eufy is constantly communicating through the network so that it can cache results, minimizing onboard operations. The Echo Dot, on the other hand, uses the least network throughput and opts to do as much on board work as possible. The Google Home sits in the middle, querying the network, for more relevant things that it can cache for when the user asks the questions. It seems they pre-request results better. It is interesting that the Google Home still sits in the middle for network throughput when it is the only one that sends UPnP at such a high frequency. However, this is mostly speculation and would be interesting to see more research on this.
