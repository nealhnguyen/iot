\chapter{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}
There are 23.14 billion IoT devices in use worldwide that nubmer is expected to grow to 75.44 billion by 2025 \cite{statista_2016}. To support the demand for these devices, 2,888 companies have jumped into the field, contributing various types of IoT devices. some devices have no support, some devices get updates but have bad support, some devices are outright malicious. Some devices have privacy and security concerns even when brand new and still technically "supported".

To address these concerns, this thesis contributes an IoT testbed that logs network and power data from 16 IoT devices over one year, accumulating 184.94 GB of data and 172,445,929 data points into a database. To help researchers sort and view this data, this thesis adds a Python \cite{python} program that graphs network traffic and power data from the database. The graphs created by this tool were used to analyze IoT devices network and power usage in the testbed while idle, during startup, and while in use. From these graphs, it appears to be possible to identify the smart speaker in use when viewing just one minute of the shared power usage.

This paper focuses on security and privacy flaws, that if fixed, do not affect the core features of an IoT device. For example, a smart speaker must store audio snippets to parse for the wake word. If the smart speaker occasionally hears a false positive wake word and sends the audio to its server, that is reasonable. However, Google Homes had an issue with their wake button, which caused the Home to listen 24/7 \cite{burke_2017}. This is not expected behavior and highlights privacy concerns.

In another sucrity flaw, one of the largest IoT cybersecurity attacks, Mirai, was able to use weak login credentials to take control of 2.5 million IoT devices to perform a denial of service attack \cite{whittaker_2017}. This is one many events that introduces security concerns. This paper uses these flaws as a focus when collecting and analyzing network and power usage.

\section{Previous Work}
\label{Previous Work}
This section presents and analyzes related works on the topic of characterizing IoT devices. It presents the previous works individually. Because these papers are similar to each other, commentary on how their work is different and useful to this paper is covered in section \ref{Scope}.

\subsection{An Analysis of Home IoT Network Traffic and Behaviour}
\label{homeIoTPaper}
In \textit{An Analysis of Home IoT Network Traffic and Behaviour}~\cite{home_iot}, the authors analyze IoT traffic in the home. The authors created an IoT testbed by setting up multiple IoT devices, connecting them to a router, sniffing their network packets while idle, and storing these packets. The IoT testbed consists of a smart air quality monitor, Amazon Echo, a few Apple devices, a smart hub, and a smart vacuum cleaner.

After 22 days of network logging, the authors analyzed each IoT device's network traffic individually and as a whole. They noticed that they can identify most devices' vendor from the first three MAC address bytes and make an assumption to what device it is. This information does not give away the exact device, but knowing a specific vendor for devices within a house creates a privacy risk.

The Hue bridge communicates over unencrypted HTTP with other devices and the outside world. The authors state that security flaw creates a privacy risk. A userâ€™s presence in a room or house can be determined from these unencrypted HTTP packets. The authors also show the percentage of network packets by protocol and various other device network patterns. This general analysis fingerprints each device.

\subsection{ProfilIoT}
\label{ProfilIoTPaper}
The paper, \textit{ProfilIoT: A Machine Learning Approach for IoT Device Identification Based on Network Traffic Analysis} ~\cite{Meidan:2017:PML:3019612.3019878} uses machine learning algorithms to classify IoT devices. The researchers of this paper collect traffic from 13 different IoT and non-IoT devices. The IOT devices include a baby monitor, motion sensor, printer, refrigerator, security camera, socket, thermostat, smartwatch, and television. The non-IoT devices include two PCs and two smartphones. These devices connect to a Wi-Fi access point that record their network traffic with Wire Shark\cite{wireshark}.

The researchers use machine learning on single-sessions to classify a device as an IoT device or non-IoT device. Then, they can classify the IoT devices by brand and model(e.g. Samsung Refrigerator, LG TV, WeMo Motion Sensor) with multi-sessions. A single-session is a 4-tuple consisting of the source IP, destination IP, source port number, and destination port number of a single TCP packet from a device. A multi-session is a list of single-sessions. Another machine learning model determines the minimum number of single-sessions needed to classify each device, determining the size of a multi-session. With single-sessions, they could determine if the device is an IoT device or not with 100 percent accuracy. Out of their nine IoT devices, they can classify brand and model of the IoT device with 99.281 percent accuracy.

\subsection{Logging and Analysis of Internet of Things (IoT) Device Network Traffic and Power Consumption}
\label{frawleyPaper}
\textit{Logging and Analysis of Internet of Things (IoT) Device Network Traffic and Power Consumption}\cite{frawley_2018}, written by Ryan Frawley, was formed in conjunction with this paper. Frawley's paper and this paper were both directed by advisor Andrew Danowitz at Cal Poly.

Frawley's paper documents the steps necessary to construct a reliable IoT testbed capable of capturing network traffic and power data for connected devices, and analyzing these devices further. He performed GeoIP\cite{maxmind} lookups on each device, showing the percentage of packets originating from each country and company. He also analyzed the packets of any unencrypted data in these devices.

\section{Scope}
\label{Scope}
The paper from subsection \ref{homeIoTPaper} most closely matches this paper. The authors have the same overall idea to collect network data and then use it to analyze metadata surrounding the networks. Our work expands on this concept by contributing a portable database consisting of 10 months of data rather than 22 days of data. This paper adds more devices in our study and focuses more on device power/network usage over time rather than specific network packet information.

Like the paper from subsection \ref{ProfilIoTPaper}, this paper also focuses on classification of devices from data. Instead of using machine learning techniques on network data, this paper focuses on manual analysis, looking for spikes, the height of the spike, the length of the power spike, and other graphical heuristics.

Compared to the paper in \ref{homeIoTPaper} and paper in \ref{ProfilIoTPaper}, this paper adds power usage over time to the data set. The two papers mentioned only focus on network traffic. This paper also puts a significant emphasis on creating an extensive database rather than a smaller set of data to create graphs on network and power usage over time.

This paper is a continuation of the third paper in subsection \ref{frawleyPaper}. Due to overlap between these two works, certain aspects of the IoT testbed setup and usage is only covered in cursory detail here. The reader is advised to access Frawley's work for full information. We both assembled the IOT test bed and interacted with the devices on a daily basis to simulate regular usage. We both also performed a preliminary analysis of the device network and power usage together.

The unique contribution of this work is its analysis of IoT device power usage and the introduction of a custom data visualization tool that attaches to the database. This paper focuses on a select few devices, analyzing their startup, idle, and in use network and power usage over time. I compare the smart speakers' network and power usage and show that it is likely possible to identify a smart speaker through analysis of the powerline over time.

\section{Thesis Organization}
Chapter \ref{Method} discusses my steps in setting up the IOT test bed, the analysis tool, and the logging system for interaction with devices. Chapter \ref{Method} also highlights the steps to set up a developer environment to run the analysis tool (realTimeIoTGrapher.py) and how to use it. Chapter \ref{Results} presents power and network traffic for smart speakers and streaming devices while idle, in use, and during startup in the form of line graphs and discuss the implications of these graphs. Chapter \ref{Results} also shows the graphs used to fingerprint the smart speakers while handling different commands and under noise. Finally, Chapter \ref{Conclusion} finishes with concluding thoughts and future work.
